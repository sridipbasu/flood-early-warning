# 🌊 floodcast

> A two-stage hybrid ML pipeline for daily riverine streamflow forecasting,
> built toward real-time flood early warning across 367 river basins.

## What This Is

Most rivers are boring 95% of the time. A flood peak the kind that displaces communities and costs lives is statistically rare. That's the core problem with training a single neural network on river data: it learns to be "average-correct" and consistently undershoots the extreme events that actually matter.

**floodcast** solves this with a residual learning architecture:
- A **2-layer LSTM** learns the temporal rhythm of each river from 15-day sequences of rainfall, soil saturation, and upstream flow signals
- An **XGBoost corrector** then sees exactly what the LSTM got wrong and fixes it using physical basin geography slope, land cover, upstream area, routing lags

The result: NSE improves from **0.43 → 0.92** on the streamflow delta prediction task. All 367 test stations achieve NSE > 0.96.
